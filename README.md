# Introduction

This is a place to keep OS X Services I made and use, along with the scripts (often AppleScripts) that they rely on. The scripts are turned into Services via Apple's Automator, often with some tweaks.

I used to use [ThisService.app](http://wafflesoftware.net/thisservice/), but now it just crashes on me in High Sierra.
