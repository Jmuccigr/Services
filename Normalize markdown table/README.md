# Normalize markdown table

This is a fairly simple wrapping of [Dr. Drang's script](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2012/11/markdown-table-scripts-for-bbedit/) into an OS X service, using Automator.

It will take the highlighted text and replace it with a nicely formatted markdown table, with spacing to make the formatting visually clear. If the selected text is not a table, you'll get an error.

I include the slightly modified python script along with the zipped service.
