This service searches a handful of places for the highlighted text, on the assumption that it's the title of an article or other academic work. It's nothing complicated, but it saves some time manually entering the search. It's explicitly uses FireFox right now because the Zotero connector works well only there.

I've also made [an iOS service](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fc7b0f9d80444cedb6d36fa8c0151740) that does the same thing (with different code, of course).
